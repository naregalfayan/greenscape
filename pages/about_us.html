        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>
          At GreenScape our mission is to bring back the culture of planting
          green life. The greener environment has many advantages,
          <br />
          which includes saving planet by making it greener, cleaner and
          healthier. The problem is that nowadays there are a lot of trees
          <br />
          being cut down and plants are being destroyed by man or by wildfires.
          Trees are used for making paper, for making furniture
          <br />
          and for many other purposes. Eventually humanity will face serious and
          unturned consequences. All humanity does is destroy
          <br />
          the ecosystem. The ecosystem needs to be restored and balanced. The
          solution that GreenScape offers is to create a habit of
          <br />
          planting trees, plants and flowers. In other words, to bring the green
          environment back to life by planting them and by learning
          <br />
          how to take care of them. Eventually this will become lifestyle for
          many of us. Even a single person who plants and who takes care
          <br />
          of the plants counts. One way, Greenscape contributes to creating a
          habit of planting, is by organizing different events. The theme
          <br />
          of those events is planting different types of trees and plants. All
          the profit of Greenscape coming from sells will go on providing

          <br />
          sources for planting events across the US. By sharing your experience
